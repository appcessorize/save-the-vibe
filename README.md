# Save The Vibe

**Save The Vibe** turns code saving from a chore into a joy. It's like adding a "save game" button to your coding – simple, fast, and fun.

## Why We Made It

Coding is changing. AI tools are bringing more people to code every day. These new coders love the creative flow – what we call "vibe coding" – but hit a wall when they need to save their work.

Git and GitHub were built for pros, not for folks who just want to create without fear.

Save The Vibe fixes this by:

- Making saving dead simple – one click and you're done
- Showing your saved work in a way that makes sense
- Letting you jump back to any point when things break
- Keeping the tech stuff hidden so you stay in your flow

No commands to learn. No confusion. No stress.

Just save your work, keep your vibe, and code with confidence.

Perfect for students, hobbyists, and anyone who wants to create without the fear of breaking things.

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements
